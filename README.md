# VBA--Challenge

Use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Create conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Create a VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
